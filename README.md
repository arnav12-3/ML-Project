## Personality Prediction using Myers Briggs Type Indicator

In today’s era, personality is one of the heavily researched and fascinating topics in psychology. Personality recognition of users is widely used in research domains like recommendation systems and human-robot interaction. Traditional recommendation systems come across problems like lack of data about the preferences of the user, free-riders problem, and the data sparsity problem. The identified user personality traits help understand users’ preferences. MBTI’s test-retest reliability hovers around a 0.5 error rate. On retest, people come out with 3–4 type preferences 75–90% of the time. Our methodology can assist with more accuracy than currently existing tests, allowing users to rely on their outcomes. Personality classification based on digital data has proved to be a more efficient alternative to traditional psychological tests.
